<h1>New York CitiBike Expansion</h1>
<h3>2013-2020</h3>

In June 2013, CitiBikes launched their new program – rented bikes with docking stations around Manhattan and Brooklyn. A rider could swipe their credit card and a bicycle would be released, allowing them the freedom to commute without the burden of maintaining their own. 

Since 2013, ridership has exploded. Millions of trips have been logged and the stations have expanded into new areas with new customers. This presentation will explore where stations have opened, how ridership has grown (by both account users and genders), and how the pandemic has affected that growth.

<b>2013 CitiBike Starting Stations Maps</b>

This visualization establishes a baseline for future trends. Blue markers indicate the most popular stations by trip count, where rentals begin. Predictably, the most commonly used stations are in Manhattan near popular landmarks - Central Park, Union Square, and along the Lower West Side. Across the river in Brooklyn, fewer bikes were docked and removed. It could be that the more remote locations (not by most standards, but without the station density of Manhattan, it may have been a dissauding factor. 

We have also established a brightline for the average length of rentals in minutes. The vast majority of all rentals were between 5 and 50 minutes. It appears the rentals in Manhattan would be substantially shorter than those in Brooklyn but the map clearly indicates that the difference between boroughs is negligible. It does appear that the variance in average times, specifically the Madison Street Station, may have skewed that station’s data. 

<b>CitiBike Expansion, Storyline</b>

Map Overview: On the first card, we can see station growth by year since 2013. The number of trips dictate the radius on each marker. The original stations have remained popular in the last 7 years. 
Station and Ridership Growth: Comparing the rental trends from original stations versus newer stations clearly shows that the first docking stations established were impeccably placed. Rentals from those locations exceeded one million by 2016 and only fell below the increased rise of newer stations in 2020. This is quite impressive considering new stations outnumbered the original two to one.
